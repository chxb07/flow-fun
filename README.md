Project Name: Network Flow Visualizer


This is a small interactive web application that allows users to:

Draw a network flow graph by adding nodes and edges

Assign capacities to each edge

Select the source (S) and sink (T) nodes

Calculate the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

Display the minimum cut visually

Features:

-Dynamic graph creation and editing

-Edge capacity visualization

-Highlights augmenting paths (optional)

-Shows max flow value and min cut edges

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
